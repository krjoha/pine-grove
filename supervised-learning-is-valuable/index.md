# Supervised learning creates more value than generative AI


What gives you a greater competitive advantage than generative AI, language models, RAG & agents? <!--more-->

## The value of supervised learning

A lot of attention and resources are being directed toward the previously mentioned buzzwords, but remember that the real, significant value lies in supervised learning.

In the graphic below, [Andrew Ng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng/) illustrates different areas of AI. We see generative AI, which has been the hot topic for the past two years, but also supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning—three fundamental pillars of machine learning. The size of the circles indicates the current value of these areas and how much Andrew predicts they will grow over the next three years.

Supervised learning looks pretty promising, doesn’t it? 👀

Sure, generative AI might be growing at a faster pace, but supervised learning still seems to hold a clear first place.

### Use cases

Let's say we accept this reasoning and set generative AI aside for a moment, what can we actually do with supervised learning? How can you use it to improve your business? 💰💵

Things you can do with supervised learning:

* Label things. (Classification) "Is this a picture of a chihuahua or a muffin? Will the user click on the ad or not?"
* Make predictions. (Regression) "How delayed will my train be? How many people will visit my restaurant next week?"
* Recommend a new TV show based on last week’s binge-watch of The Bear 🐻👨‍🍳.

There are countless problems and challenges that AI can help solve, and you—the expert in your business and domain—know best what’s valuable to tackle!

That said, building AI solutions is more complex than just programming logic into your application, so you might not even need supervised learning. Sometimes, a few well-placed lines of code are all it takes.

Either way, if any of this sounds interesting, feel free to reach out!
