<h2 id="the-value-of-supervised-learning">The value of supervised learning</h2>
<p>A lot of attention and resources are being directed toward the previously mentioned buzzwords, but remember that the real, significant value lies in supervised learning.</p>
<p>In the graphic below, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Andrew Ng</a>
 illustrates different areas of AI. We see generative AI, which has been the hot topic for the past two years, but also supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learningâ€”three fundamental pillars of machine learning. The size of the circles indicates the current value of these areas and how much Andrew predicts they will grow over the next three years.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Developer experience matters a lot</title><link>https://pgi.dev/developer-experience-matters-a-lot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2025 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><author>Kristoffer Johansson</author><guid>https://pgi.dev/developer-experience-matters-a-lot/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>In order for develovers to be succ.. ðŸš§ðŸš¨ Developers needs a.. ðŸš§ðŸš¨</p>

<p>This is what the developer experience (DevEx) feels like in many larger, long-established organizations with significant technical debt. Add to that the constant pinging of chat windows and overflowing inboxes, and youâ€™ve got a recipe for sluggish deliveries and frustrated developers!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Services in AI &amp; Data Engineering</title><link>https://pgi.dev/offer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2025 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><author>Kristoffer Johansson</author><guid>https://pgi.dev/offer/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>We leverage our expertise in AI and data engineering to make your business more efficient.
