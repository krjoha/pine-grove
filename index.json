You load data, explore it, train a model, validate it, and call it done. This works for experimentation, but it creates a problem: the entire workflow lives on your laptop in a linear, manual process. The typical data science workflow: Data Analysis - Explore and understand your dataset Preprocessing - Clean and transform data Model Training - Fit your model to the data Model Validation - Check if it actually works Model Handover - Hope someone can deploy it Each step runs manually. No automation. No versioning. No way to reproduce results reliably. When your model performs well in validation, you face a question: how do you get this into production? The handover problem scales differently, but exists everywhere At a small company, one person handles everything from data analysis to deployment. The handover happens between different hats the same person wears. At medium and large companies, data scientists build models but struggle to hand them over to engineering teams. The model that worked perfectly in a notebook fails in production, or worse, sits unused because deployment is too difficult. MLOps practices built on CI/CD principles solve this by eliminating the handover entirely. Instead of passing artifacts between teams or roles, you build automated pipelines that move code from experimentation to production. The same pipeline that trains your model also deploys it.

Literally. The ’throw it over the fence’ workflow: data scientists and engineers work in isolation. Image credits swirlai.com Look at the diagram above. On the left, the data scientist works in Jupyter, connected to the data warehouse. They analyze data, preprocess it, train a model, validate it. At the end of this pipeline sits Model Handover (step 1). Then comes the wall. The brick wall in the middle represents organizational separation. The model artifact gets dumped into a bucket (step 2) and passed to the other side. No training context. No preprocessing code. No validation metrics. Just a pickled model file and hope. On the right side, the software engineer receives this artifact (step 3). They attempt deployment (step 4), wrap it in a container, and expose it to product applications (step 5). Then reality hits. Why this pattern fails The model that achieved 95% accuracy in the notebook gets 60% in production. Why? Different data distributions: Training used last month’s data, production sees today’s data Missing preprocessing: The notebook had 10 cells of data cleaning that never got documented Dependency mismatches: Model trained with scikit-learn 1.4, production runs 1.0 No monitoring: When accuracy drops, nobody notices for weeks This workflow breaks because it treats model development and deployment as separate problems. The data scientist optimizes for accuracy in experiments. The engineer optimizes for reliability in production. These goals conflict when there’s a wall between them. Documentation doesn’t fix this. READMEs get outdated. Comments get ignored. What you need is shared infrastructure that both roles interact with during their work.

Three automated pipelines replace manual handoffs: Data Engineering (warehouse to curated data), ML Training (preprocessing through validation), and Deployment (registry to production). At the center sits a metadata hub with three components: Experiment Tracker: Logs metrics and parameters from every training run ML Metadata Store: Tracks data lineage and artifact relationships Model Registry: Stores versioned models ready for deployment An orchestrator like Airflow runs these pipelines on schedules or triggers, creating a Continuous Training loop where models retrain automatically as data changes. The wall is gone. Both data scientists and engineers interact with the same registry and metadata store. The model that gets deployed is the exact model that was validated, with full lineage tracking.

The workshop builds a sentiment classification model using scikit-learn’s Pipeline to chain a TF-IDF vectorizer with logistic regression. Here’s the core training logic (see tasks/train_model.py for full implementation): # Create pipeline pipeline = Pipeline([ ('tfidf', TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1500, ngram_range=(1, 2))), ('classifier', LogisticRegression(random_state=42, max_iter=1000)) ]) # Train and log with MLflow with mlflow.start_run(experiment_id=experiment_id) as run: # Log parameters and train mlflow.log_param(\"vectorizer_max_features\", 1500) pipeline.fit(df['text'], df['sentiment']) # Log metrics cv_scores = cross_val_score(pipeline, df['text'], df['sentiment'], cv=3) mlflow.log_metric(\"cv_mean_accuracy\", cv_scores.mean()) # Register model in MLflow registry model_info = mlflow.sklearn.log_model(sk_model=pipeline, artifact_path=\"model\") mlflow.register_model(model_uri=model_info.model_uri, name=\"sentiment_classifier\") The key insight: mlflow.register_model() puts the trained model into a central registry where downstream pipelines can load it by name, not by file path. This separation between training and deployment means data scientists can register multiple model versions, and engineers can load the latest version without touching training code.

All tracked in MLflow. The workshop put MLOps theory into practice. Attendees built complete pipelines with MLflow tracking, Airflow orchestration, and automated monitoring running on their own laptops. The same architecture that handled sentiment classification in the workshop scales to fraud detection, recommendation systems, or demand forecasting in production. What makes this approach work is eliminating the handoff. When data scientists and engineers both interact with a shared model registry, the “throw it over the fence” problem disappears. Automated pipelines catch issues during development, not in production. Monitoring tracks trends across runs instead of waiting for users to report problems.

To mention a few, you can: sort support tickets by priority, filter out spam, route customer inquiries to the right department, analyze sentiment (what people think) in product reviews. A traditional machine learning approach requires thousands of labeled examples in a so-called dataset. That means you need someone to manually label 5,000+ emails as “spam” or “not spam” before training a model can begin. That can be expensive and slow (and boring), which means most organizations don’t have thousands of pre-labeled examples sitting around. This is where the SetFit method comes in: it uses powerful pre-trained transformer models that we fine-tune on as few as two examples per class. Much easier to manage than 5,000 examples!

Unlike older methods that treat words as isolated tokens, BERT captures meaning based on surrounding words. Consider these sentences: “He biked to work.” “He drove his car to work.” “Peter decided to take his bike to the beach.” BERT understands that “biked” and “bike” relate to the same concept, while “drove his car” represents a different mode of transport. This contextual understanding is what makes modern NLP powerful. And what’s extra good is that there are open-source platforms like HuggingFace filled with these small, pre-trained BERT models that already know a lot about our world. We just need to provide a few examples of our task to retrain the models to become good at what we want.

Whether two sentences are “similar” depends entirely on what you’re measuring. If we look from the perspective of public transportation, we might be interested in knowing which mode of transport is mentioned in the text. Then we can imagine that examples might be paired like this: Negative pair (different modes of transport): “He biked to work.” “He drove his car to work.” Positive pair (same mode of transport): “He biked to work.” “Peter decided to take his bike to the beach.” Negative pair (different modes of transport): “Peter decided to take his bike to the beach.” “He drove his car to work.” But if we’re interested in knowing where someone is going, we would need to pair the examples in a completely different way. This is important because transformer models learn these contextual relationships from massive datasets when they were initially trained. That means the models have seen data that might not match exactly what you want to measure! And this is where SetFit comes in.

SetFit works in two stages: Contrastive learning: Train on sentence pairs to learn which examples are similar and which are different Classification head: Train a simple classifier on top of the learned embeddings Doing it this way leverages the vast knowledge already baked into transformer models. You’re not teaching the model language and concepts from scratch. Instead, you’re teaching it your specific classification task using the language understanding the model already has.

In the graphic below, Andrew Ng illustrates different areas of AI. We see generative AI, which has been the hot topic for the past two years, but also supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning—three fundamental pillars of machine learning. The size of the circles indicates the current value of these areas and how much Andrew predicts they will grow over the next three years. Supervised learning looks pretty promising, doesn’t it? 👀 Sure, generative AI might be growing at a faster pace, but supervised learning still seems to hold a clear first place.

How can you use it to improve your business? 💰💵 Things you can do with supervised learning: Label things. (Classification) “Is this a picture of a chihuahua or a muffin? Will the user click on the ad or not?” Make predictions. (Regression) “How delayed will my train be? How many people will visit my restaurant next week?” Recommend a new TV show based on last week’s binge-watch of The Bear 🐻👨‍🍳. There are countless problems and challenges that AI can help solve, and you—the expert in your business and domain—know best what’s valuable to tackle! That said, building AI solutions is more complex than just programming logic into your application, so you might not even need supervised learning. Sometimes, a few well-placed lines of code are all it takes. Either way, if any of this sounds interesting, feel free to reach out!

Your task is to create a new application to manage the company’s quotes. “No problem, I’ll have a first version ready by next week!” you say as you reach for the keyboard… After some intense typing, you get to the part where you need to save information to a database. “Surely one of my 500 developer colleagues has solved this 100 times before. I’ll check Git and see how they did it” you think as you open a new tab with GitLab in your browser. Empty. What? Where’re all the repositories? Turns out all code repositories are set to “private” by default. And apparently, there isn’t just one instance of GitLab—there are at least three, though you don’t know about the others yet. On top of that, you have no idea which team to ask for access because, as it turns out, GitLab groups are also set to “private” by default.

This is an example of an unnecessary hurdle that shouldn’t exist. The solution? Start by changing the default setting to “internal”, making all code visible to all developers. And maybe consider consolidating those other GitLab instances while you’re at it? Even better: What if Acme Big Tech Inc. had an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) like Backstage from Spotify ? It would make things so much easier by showing which services are running and which team is responsible for them. What if the processes were designed for speed and trust, without forcing pull request reviews on everything? Instead of waiting for a review, sit down and work together!
