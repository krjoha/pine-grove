In the graphic below, Andrew Ng illustrates different areas of AI. We see generative AI, which has been the hot topic for the past two years, but also supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning‚Äîthree fundamental pillars of machine learning. The size of the circles indicates the current value of these areas and how much Andrew predicts they will grow over the next three years. Supervised learning looks pretty promising, doesn‚Äôt it? üëÄ Sure, generative AI might be growing at a faster pace, but supervised learning still seems to hold a clear first place.

There are countless problems and challenges that AI can help solve, and you‚Äîthe expert in your business and domain‚Äîknow best what‚Äôs valuable to tackle!
