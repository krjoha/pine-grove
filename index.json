Your task is to create a new application to manage the company‚Äôs quotes. ‚ÄúNo problem, I‚Äôll have a first version ready by next week!‚Äù you say as you reach for the keyboard‚Ä¶ After some intense typing, you get to the part where you need to save information to a database. ‚ÄúSurely one of my 500 developer colleagues has solved this 100 times before. I‚Äôll check Git and see how they did it‚Äù you think as you open a new tab with GitLab in your browser. Empty. What? Where‚Äôre all the repositories? Turns out all code repositories are set to ‚Äúprivate‚Äù by default. And apparently, there isn‚Äôt just one instance of GitLab‚Äîthere are at least three, though you don‚Äôt know about the others yet. On top of that, you have no idea which team to ask for access because, as it turns out, GitLab groups are also set to ‚Äúprivate‚Äù by default.

This is an example of an unnecessary hurdle that shouldn‚Äôt exist. The solution? Start by changing the default setting to ‚Äúinternal‚Äù, making all code visible to all developers. And maybe consider consolidating those other GitLab instances while you‚Äôre at it? Even better: What if Acme Big Tech Inc. had an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) like Backstage from Spotify? It would make things so much easier by showing which services are running and which team is responsible for them. What if the processes were designed for speed and trust, without forcing pull request reviews on everything? Instead of waiting for a review, sit down and work together!
