# Pine Grove Interactive

A static website for my company, hosted at <https://pgi.dev>, built with Hugo and KeepIt.

## Description

If you are intrested in hosting your own static site like this one I would recommend to AVOID forking this repository. Instead you should install Hugo, add a theme (if you want one) and initialize a new repository. I failed to get a proper setup working with gitmodules, and had to hard copy the theme repository here with slight modifications.
